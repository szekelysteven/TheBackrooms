# TheBackrooms
Repository for Game 469 Group Project

Weclome to the repository for the game The Backrooms! Here is a quick start up guide

Setting up Local GitHub File (Only has to be done once): • Post your email so I can send you an invite to allow updating to the GitHub repository.

• Install GitHub desktop

• Goto the GitHub repository website for the game and click the green button on the right labeled Code>Download Using GitHub Desktop.

• The project should download to Documents>GitHub>Game Name or you can change the folder.

• Click Clone, Initilize GitLFS if it asks.

• Add a link to this project folder in Unity Hub.

• Open project in Unity.

When ready to upload changes:

• Save and Close out of unity.

• Inside of GitHub desktop, create a summary and description, make sure all changes are checked. Make folders like Library are not added.

• Click commit to master.

• Click push to fully upload to repository.

Be sure to fetch origin before starting any work for the day so that you don’t rollback anyone’s stuff. I think the desktop app should be able to catch this.
