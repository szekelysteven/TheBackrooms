  - text: 'This is Private investigator Casey Flynn. I have been offered a missing
      person''s case. His name is Gregg Garcia, a 38 year old man who runs a conspiracy
      theory podcast. For months hes been claiming to reveal the truth about Cineworth
      Valley. Gregg claims the town is trying to summon an angel or something. Sounds
      like a bunch of fairy tales to me. He frequently shopped at the Grace and Mercy
      store. My best bet is to start there. '
